			<h2>What is most important to me?</h2>
			<p>Respect is really important to me. I feel like everyone deserves some level<br>
				of respect. It's really not that hard to be respectful towards others.</p>
			<h2>What would I sacrifice?</h2>
			<p>I would sacrifice many things if it means safety or peace for my friends/family.<br>
                           I'm not sure exactly what it would be, but I would work hard and stuff.</p>
